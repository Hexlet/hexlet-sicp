        "The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. If f is a function and dx is some small number, " .
        "then the smoothed version of f is the function whose value at a point x is the average of f(x - dx), f(x), and f(x + dx). " .
        "Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f. " .
