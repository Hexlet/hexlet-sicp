        "Eva Lu Ator has a criticism of Louis's approach in exercise 3.75. " .
        "The program he wrote is not modular, because it intermixes the operation of smoothing with the zero-crossing extraction. " .
        "For example, the extractor should not have to be changed if Alyssa finds a better way to condition her input signal. " .
        "Help Louis by writing a procedure smooth that takes a stream as input and produces a stream in which each element is the average of two successive input stream elements. " .
        "Then use smooth as a component to implement the zero-crossing detector in a more modular style."
