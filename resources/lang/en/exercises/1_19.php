        'There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. ' .
        'Recall the transformation of the state variables a and b in the fib-iter process of section 1.2.2: a ← a + b and b ← a. ' .
        'Call this transformation T, and observe that applying T over and over again n times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair Fib(n + 1) and Fib(n). ' .
        'In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying Tⁿ, the nth power of the transformation T, starting with the pair (1,0). ' .
        'Now consider T to be the special case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of transformations Tpq, where Tpq transforms the pair (a,b) according to a ← bq + aq + ap and b ← bp + aq. ' .
        "Show that if we apply such a transformation Tpq twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation Tp'q' of the same form, and compute p' and q' in terms of p and q. " .
        'This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute Tⁿ using successive squaring, as in the fast-expt procedure. ' .
        'Put this all together to complete the following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:'
